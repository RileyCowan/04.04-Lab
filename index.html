  <h1>5 Things to Know About Rattlesnakes and Their Babies</h1>

  <p>UA College of Pharmacy | Aug. 6, 2014</p>

  <p>In Arizona, snake season can last all year, but baby rattlesnakes are typically born in July and August. These months can be particularly risky for hikers, gardeners, children, and others who might encounter rattlesnakes.</p>

  <p>So far this year, the Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center has recorded 74 rattlesnake bites to humans. Located at the University of Arizona College of Pharmacy, the center serves almost the entire state, providing 24/7 free and confidential advice about poison and medication exposure.</p>

  <p>Staff at the center often receive calls from Arizonans of all ages who don’t realize they’ve been bitten by a rattler. The center urges anyone who experiences a sudden sting, pinch, or bite while outdoors to call immediately at 800-222-1222.</p>

  <p>"We ask a few questions to help identify whether it was a snakebite or not," said Keith Boesen, director of the Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center. "Prompt medical attention can significantly improve outcomes for anyone bitten."</p>

  <p>The center recommends being aware of these five key facts when encountering rattlesnakes:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Baby rattlesnakes measure 6 to 12 inches and blend in easily with brush and grass.</li>
    <li>They don’t have rattles until their first shed, so you might not hear the warning sound before they strike.</li>
    <li>Even small baby snakes carry enough venom to pose a serious danger if they bite.</li>
    <li>Adult rattlesnakes don’t always rattle before or during a bite.</li>
    <li>If you see an unexplained cut or wound, call the poison center—even if it doesn’t hurt. Without a rattle warning, bites can go unnoticed until symptoms appear.</li>
  </ol>
